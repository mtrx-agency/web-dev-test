      '<p id="">Online learning has long ceased to be something extraordinary. Remember when folks signed up for online courses and training just to improve their skills or boost their credentials?&nbsp;</p><p id="">You might find it surprising, but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/online-colleges/online-learning-stats/" id="">over 8.5 million U.S. students</a> are enrolled in online classes at public colleges and universities. And this number keeps growing yearly because of the advantages of online learning.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Learning from home is much more convenient and allows for a better study-life balance. If you\'re considering making the switch, this article is for you. Dive in to discover why remote learning is good and what pitfalls to consider.</p><h2 id="">What is Remote Learning in 2024: Overview</h2><p id="">Remote learning is an approach that allows students to engage in their studies from any corner of the world without the need to attend schools or colleges physically. People prefer such an approach due to flexibility and focus on self-education.&nbsp;</p><p id="">One of the core advantages of online learning is that it fosters autonomy and self-discipline. Students access courses and do their homework when it suits their schedules, combining acquiring knowledge with other commitments, plans, and duties.&nbsp;</p><p id="">We’re lucky to live in a digital era since technological innovations enhance our education experience. In 2023, people were excited by mixed reality glasses by Meta and Apple. They allow users to create their own avatars and virtual classrooms to foster peer-to-peer communication and save the feeling of offline learning.&nbsp;</p><p id="">That technology was eye-opening, but 2024 brought us an Artificial Intelligence revolution that completely changed how we engage in classes. Now, you can open ChatGPT 4.0 and ask it to be your tutor for Spanish, coding, or anything else you want to master. And it will. We’re talking about large language models that know literally everything needed to be the best tutor you’ve ever had.&nbsp;</p><p id="">So, remote education this year is more about technology and accessibility of knowledge. Considering the trends, most colleges will keep them in mind to engage more students. Now we’re talking rather about a hybrid form of studying as an optimal option, considering the pros and cons of remote learning. But in the few upcoming years, we should expect the implementation of an entirely remote model available to all.</p><h3 id="">Advantages of Online Learning to Consider</h3><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Flexibility: </strong>Your classes are available 24/7 from anywhere. A stable Internet connection is the only thing needed. Now, you can save time usually wasted getting to college and spend it how you want to. Moreover, remote education allows you to travel a lot, have regular workations, and set up a healthy study-life balance.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Accessibility: </strong>Among the core advantages of remote learning is an ability to access it everywhere. Remote study is an excellent opportunity for everybody, including people with disabilities and vulnerable groups, to use their basic right to education. Now, you can find hundreds of classes from well-known colleges and universities worldwide absolutely free. The impact of remote learning on students is huge since everybody can feel needed, heard, and engaged.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Personalization: </strong>Do you know why most prefer one-on-one classes to group learning? We want personalized service and 100% of the tutor\'s attention. Remote learning in education means providing a student-oriented experience, avoiding the one-size-fits-all approach we’re used to. Adaptive study technologies modify content in real-time based on student preferences and needs, ensuring each learner receives a tailored remote learning experience.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Another thing we love about remote learning is its affordability. It is relatively cheap and sometimes even free. The price difference between offline and online types depends on institutions\' overhead level. You don\'t need anything except your laptop and connection to start learning. In the meantime, online education helps educational institutions reduce administrative expenses and resources consumed.</li></ul><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="1"></div></div><h3 id="">Disadvantages of Online Learning</h3><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Limited Social Interaction: </strong>eLearning offers flexibility and convenience, but it also reduces the chances of in-person chats and the classic classroom vibe. Eventually, students might feel lonely without those fun and lively social interactions.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Self-discipline:</strong> Effective online study requires students\' complete dedication, motivation, and discipline. You should be responsible for your classes and schedules, doing your best to master a new discipline. Sometimes, the absence of a traditional classroom and daily commitments make it challenging for students to remain focused. However, the core task here is to overcome this issue and pay needed attention to your online learning.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Evaluation and Feedback: </strong>In online environments, assessing student performance and providing timely, meaningful feedback can be tricky. The absence of face-to-face interactions can make it difficult to gauge student understanding and engagement effectively.&nbsp;</li></ul><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="2"></div></div><h3 id="">Bonus point: Top 5 Colleges &amp; Universities Offering Distance Learning Benefits</h3><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="https://onlineprograms.uic.edu" id="">University of Illinois, Chicago</a></li><li id=""><a href="https://spia.chass.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/lps/" id="">North Carolina State University</a></li><li id=""><a href="https://admissions.oregonstate.edu/apply-choose-application" id="">​​Oregon State University</a></li><li id=""><a href="https://online.arizona.edu/admissions/how-apply" id="">University of Arizona</a></li><li id=""><a href="https://online.wsu.edu" id="">Washington State University</a></li></ul><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="3"></div></div><h2 id="">Offline or online education: which one is for you?&nbsp;</h2><p id="">If you’re here, you most likely must make a tough choice between remote and offline learning. But before making such a huge decision, you should know that remote learning has its peculiarities. You can always opt for it, even learning offline, but it is far from always able to replace full-fledged learning.&nbsp;</p><p id="">For example, if you want to be a doctor, engineer, or pilot, studying in your college\'s classrooms is a must—no exceptions. However, you can upgrade your skills using eLearning opportunities.</p><p id="">In turn, if you’re going to be a digital marketer or software developer, feel free to opt for 100% remote learning since all the resources you need to become an expert are on the web.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="4"></div></div><h3 id="">Education Requirements for Various Professions</h3><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><table border="1">\n  <tr>\n    <th><strong>Offline Education Only</strong></th>\n    <th><strong>Offline/Online Education</strong></th>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>In-Person Learning</td>\n    <td>In-Person Learning</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>High flexibility in scheduling.</td>\n    <td>High flexibility in scheduling.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Requires physical presence, limiting access to those who can commute or relocate.</td>\n    <td>Accessible from any location with Internet connectivity, breaking down geographical barriers.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Facilitates direct social interaction and engagement with peers and instructors.</td>\n    <td>Facilitates direct social interaction and engagement with peers and instructors.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Minimal reliance on technology for remote learning in the education process.</td>\n    <td>Minimal reliance on technology for remote learning in the education process.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Less flexibility for personalization, though some teachers may adjust learning plans based on class needs.</td>\n    <td>Less flexibility for personalization, though some teachers may adjust learning plans based on class needs.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Engagement through face-to-face discussions, group projects, and in-person activities.</td>\n    <td>Engagement through face-to-face discussions, group projects, and in-person activities.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Immediate feedback through direct interaction in class.</td>\n    <td>Immediate feedback through direct interaction in class.</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Higher costs due to travel, accommodation, and campus facilities.</td>\n    <td>Higher costs due to travel, accommodation, and campus facilities.</td>\n  </tr>\n</table></div><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="5"></div></div><h3 id="">Remote Learning vs In Person: Comparison</h3><p id="">What are the advantages and disadvantages of online learning and offline one?

Here are a few tips on how to fix this.</p><ol id=""><li id="">Find a quiet and suitable place for studying.</li><li id="">Mute your electronic devices during the study process.</li><li id="">Ask your family and friends not to bother you during this time.</li><li id="">Try to catch a flow state to be more productive and engaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="8"></div></div><h3 id="">Time Management</h3><p id="">Do you need the 25th hour of your day? You’re not alone. To catch up with online lessons, you need to become an excellent time manager. Since you don’t have bell times or a strictly defined schedule, it’s a must to keep your own learning process under control. Learn effectively, and don’t forget to recharge.&nbsp;</p><p id="">How to achieve it?</p><ol id=""><li id="">Create your schedule combining lessons and leisure time</li><li id="">Work on the habit of completing your work on time</li><li id="">Use the 5-minute rule: dedicate at least 5 minutes of your time for each task in your pipeline&nbsp;</li></ol><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="9"></div></div><h3 id="">Internet Access</h3><p id="">While telecom companies are working on providing us with 5G and satellite connectivity, you still need to ensure a stable Internet connection in your place.

Some say it’s not as efficient as the traditional process we’re used to. However, it depends on your attitude and desire to make the education process efficient. The advantages of distance learning are obviously significant. So if you decide to start this journey, remember to keep a healthy study-life balance: plan your schedule accordingly, opt for <a href="https://paper24.com/" id="">paper help</a> if needed, and focus on the learning.

This tool might be very useful for new programmers or first year students. However, as code becomes more advanced, it will struggle to provide applicable solutions to problems.&nbsp;</p><p id="">With academic writing, students might be able to gather ideas and make a draft, but they will still have to spend hours researching, citing, editing and proofreading their work.

This can result in a lack of authenticity in the paper, which may be detected by professors and other academic reviewers.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Lack of critical thinking skills:</strong> By relying on AI to write their papers, students stop developing their critical thinking skills. Writing papers requires students to research, analyze, and synthesize information, which are important skills to grow.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Dependency:</strong> If students become too reliant on AI to write their papers, they may struggle to complete assignments on their own when AI is not available. This can lead to a lack of independence and self-sufficiency.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Quality of the paper:</strong> AI-generated content may not be of the same quality as a paper written by a human. This can result in a lower grade or a lack of understanding by the reader.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Lack of understanding:</strong> If students use AI to write their papers without fully understanding the content, they may struggle to explain or defend the ideas presented in the paper. This can lead to a lack of confidence in their own understanding of the subject matter and suspicion from a teacher/professor of cheating.&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">Reputational concerns:</strong> Using AI to write papers may raise ethical concerns, as it could be seen as cheating or taking shortcuts.

However, based on several sources, most professors don’t seem to be too concerned about it.</p><p id="">They are fairly confident in the fact that they will be able to detect AI writing apart from the writing of typical students, as most students have a “idiosyncratic” and “unique” writing style, while most AI writing follows a similar pattern. It also lacks critical thinking skills, and is better at regurgitating facts rather than building a strong argument.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-normal" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="normal"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/634e71ff52ffb6491eeec510/63b433661b6d28674df0b3d4_rh1WniZm-JpjnHnno4kNsvT4neKP-2nE_M4yxek1UJbpnZ4LGOCtOFmNy7NH3lJfDi9xjaUEy4TG08Oia_3rWHchlGFs-KF5l7N8T-nAvUjhLF8EDoCsvk_YsZLeDgSrFykbCSIkLnLQddFLzrN9sbCDxliJ5l5pU-xY-BKRkUZmRuKCj1AV-SSsQhpTpQ.png" id="" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto"></div></figure><p id="">However, teachers understand that this instrument will increase the amount of students attempting to cheat.

AR/VR and MR are headliners</h3><p id="">Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR), new trends in education, were highly supported by the recent launching of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Apple Vision Pro. These gadgets are world-famous for the immersive learning experiences they provide while mixing and fluidly blurring the real and digital worlds. Apple is projected to have shipped 350,000 Vision Pro units in 2024 and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1398458/apple-vision-pro-shipments/#:~:text=Apple%20Vision%20Pro%20shipment%20forecast%20worldwide%202024%2D2028&text=With%20an%20expected%20release%20some,million%20devices%20in%20year%20two." id="">1.48 million in 2025</a>, showing that the demand for the new education tool is fast growing.</p><p id="">With its fully immersive environments, VR technology enables students to wander and interact in 3D worlds. It makes things like biology and history pretty accessible and exciting, allowing you to perceive the educational material in the smallest details.</p><p id="">On the other hand, AR overlays the real world with added digital information to enhance textbooks and classrooms, extending learning opportunities through an interactive experience.</p><p id="">The MR technology blends the real and virtual worlds to develop settings in which the physical and digital objects coexist and intermingle in real time for shared or interactive learning.</p><p id="">An excellent example of VR usage in education is the association between Arizona State University and Dreamscape for the release of <a href="https://dreamscapelearn.asu.edu/how-it-works/" id="">Learn Lab</a>. The lab currently applies VR, hand tracking, and haptic feedback in teaching biology, with scores showing an increase of 10% over conventional methods.</p><p id="">‍</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/634e71ff52ffb6491eeec510/6613b9af81c3fdd20b15db12_-88F0C1VZaJjSNq7fyaEsZ3QWa-0jMsrHKvYDZivdvCJEy1p4VTrU12FU3uvWw5d1-NkWfJi-C-UjXY5gK-26hhkwOq10z4DLKxeD3oCETJzSSWRdKs2C_ZoG8ATpe7_IQV-aMIFW8sh697sPdV3PAg.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="" loading="auto" id=""></div></figure><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="3"></div></div><h3 id="">2. AI is a proven education assistant</h3><p id="">Often compared with the new Internet, the AI democratization boom of 2023 provides vast education opportunities. Today, students use AI to guide one-on-one, tailored learning experiences, get academic support on the go when needed, or even optimize study habits with tools like smart tutors or AI-powered research helpers. ChatGPT 4.0, for instance, has offered plenty of opportunities to learn programming, languages, or any other discipline with AI tutors.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Considering the buzz around this innovation, it obviously became fuel for future trends in education, fostering digitization and a smooth virtual learning experience.</p><p id="">The Georgia Institute of Technology provides a vivid example of how much AI upgrades education. This far-reading school introduced an <a href="https://pe.gatech.edu/blog/meet-jill-watson-georgia-techs-first-ai-teaching-assistant" id="">AI-powered chatbot, Jill Watson</a>, in 2016. The product was developed with IBM\'s Watson technology and had a 97% accuracy rate, guiding through about 10,000 student questions per semester.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="4"></div></div><h3 id="">3. Remote-first education preferred</h3><p id="">Remote, online, and hybrid learning became a new norm during and after the pandemic. Just like most employees aren\'t eager to return to the traditional offices, the students don\'t want to go back to campuses. The numbers speak for themselves:&nbsp;</p><ul id=""><li id=""><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10047520/#:~:text=Most%20students%20preferred%20online%20learning,online%20or%20on%2Dcampus%20learning." id="">38.2% of the students</a> would opt for online learning;&nbsp;</li><li id="">36.7% of respondents prefer on-campus learning;</li><li id="">25.1% benefit from hybrid learning.&nbsp;</li></ul><p id="">Curious that about 2/3 of the students had a positive attitude toward online and hybrid learning due to support from educational institutions.</p><p id="">Universities and colleges the world over have caught on to the spread of complete online or hybrid programs that cover dozens of different subjects and degrees for several reasons:</p><ol id=""><li id="">Online and hybrid learning increase student productivity and participation.</li><li id="">Students have access to a broader range of resources.</li><li id="">Due to online &amp; hybrid learning, education institutions can reduce campus maintenance and labor costs.</li><li id="">And last but not least, remote learning means safety and health protection.</li></ol><p id="">Now, most institutions offer at least one remote course. You can choose from Arizona State University, the University of Pennsylvania, or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, among others.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="5"></div></div><h3 id="">4. Soft Skills &amp; STEM Trending in Education</h3><p id="">STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) is a set of disciplines crucial for people in the digital era. Some new education trends are expected to direct students to soft skill development, which includes communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability when joining STEM courses. So, STEM &amp; Soft Skills can be officially recognized among current educational trends.</p><p id="">Since it\'s challenging for tech specialists to develop soft skills, colleges have decided to narrow the gap between technical STEM education and the soft skills employers seek.&nbsp;</p><p id="">For example, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology integrates the development of leadership and communication abilities into its engineering courses. At the same time, Stanford University offers design thinking courses for learners to acquire creative and innovative skill sets required in any professional area.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="6"></div></div><h2 id="">What are the current trends in teacher education?</h2><p id="">Education industry trends are for students only? How about trends in teaching? They are a lighthouse for tutors and professors, helping them deliver information in a form acceptable and preferred by the target audience.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Since educators are the first to try trends in practice, they must keep all the innovations on the radar. Shadowing the mainstream helps tutors support student engagement and ensures that teaching methods are up to date.</p><p id="">If you\'re here to discover what\'s new in the tutoring world, we can offer you at least five trends to consider.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Experiential Learning:</strong> Share practice, not theory — this is the core teaching trend to consider. Students appreciate the hands-on experience you talk about because it lets them explore the peculiarities of their future work. Therefore, tutors should organize web quests, lab sessions, and field trips to show what\'s behind the hood of each discipline.&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">Microlearning: </strong>People are now used to quick and simple data sharing. It makes tutors go online and give insights in a short text or video format. Microlearning breaks down content into bite-sized, manageable pieces. You can use it for your classes. This practice helps improve retention and engagement by presenting information in short, focused sessions​.</p><p id=""><strong id="">Soft Skills Development: </strong>Now, they matter even more than hard skills. Therefore, tutors should be like mentors, psychologists, and friends in one bottle for students. Strive to foster their critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and adaptability alongside academic subjects.&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">Lifelong Learning:</strong> If you demonstrate your desire to learn despite your age and degree, your students will do the same. Here, professors should always work on their education and accumulate specific skills in a matter of days to share them right away.&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">Decentralized Education Platforms: </strong>Blockchain technology in education fosters secure and transparent handling of educational records and achievements, simplifying transfers between institutions and enhancing data ownership. Tutors should join organizations like Studyum to increase awareness and facilitate the transition to new work conditions.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="7"></div></div><h2 id="">Current Educational Trends Depending on Field: Overview</h2><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="8"></div></div><h3 id="">Software Engineering&nbsp;</h3><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Coding bootcamps and microcredentials:</strong> Traditional degree programs have held a monopoly until a coding bootcamp and microcredential came in to supplement them with a focus on practical experience with coding, app, and web development. These educational approaches use accelerated learning in short time frames.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) integration: </strong>Subjects related to AI and ML are being inducted into the curriculum, not in just one subject but with the intention of incorporating these subjects into project work to prepare the students for coming advancements in the software engineering field.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Emphasis on soft skills:</strong> Even in the technical professions, the value of teamwork, communication, and problem-solving abilities show increasing recognition. To improve these skills, students often undertake collaborative projects that look quite like the teams from real development courses.</li></ul><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="9"></div></div><h3 id="">Marketing</h3><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Focus on digital marketing:</strong> Since most consumers are now online, marketing courses have increasingly focused on digital strategies, social media marketing, SEO, and content marketing. All marketing students need to get used to digital platforms and analytic tools.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Real-world projects:</strong> Marketing students engage in real-world projects that help them work directly with companies or not-for-profit organizations. Such experience is highly valued as it boosts skills in conducting market research, planning campaigns, and performing them.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Sustainability:</strong> Sustainable marketing practices and ethical considerations are issues that are getting increasing attention from consumers who are becoming more environmentally sensitive. Students need to learn how to develop marketing strategies that are both effective and responsible toward society.</li></ul><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="10"></div></div><h3 id="">Medical Education</h3><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Simulation-Based Learning:</strong> With the help of AR/VR, medical students can safely and competently practice surgical interventions and doctor-patient communications side by side. Simulated learning tools are part of the hands-on experience in medical training without the risk.</li><li id=""><strong id="">Genomics and Personalized Medicine:</strong> The emerging fields of personalized medicine draw on advancements, in which educational programs are urged to fold genomics, biotechnology, and personalized medicine in their curricula. The depth of genetic information and how it can be implemented in patient care is a new development area for all physicians.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Training in Telehealth:</strong> Telehealth services have recently been in briskly increasing demand, more so during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth training has also been made a core component of medical student training. On this account, medical students are taught how to conduct remote consultations, either for patients or with the respective digital health technologies.</li></ul><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="11"></div></div><h2 id="">Top 4 Current Educational Issues To Overcome&nbsp;</h2><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="12"></div></div><h3 id="">AI in Education</h3><p id="">Yes, it’s not a mistake; Artificial Intelligence is among both educational trends and issues.</p><p id="">Integrating Gen AI technologies within the educational framework offers many opportunities and dilemmas as well.&nbsp;</p><p id="">While AI provides greater learning experiences, it has also come with its fair share of issues relating to data accuracy and security. Instead of asking for <a href="https://paper24.com/" id="">paper help</a> or diligently working on another case study, some students use this technology to cut corners, thereby missing out on valuable knowledge.</p><p id="">Thus, educational institutions and even state authorities develop policies that define rules for Artificial Intelligence usage.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="13"></div></div><h3 id="">Digital Divides</h3><p id="">The 2024 National Educational Technology Plan highlights three critical divides:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Digital Use Divide, focusing on enhancing how technology is used in learning;</li><li id="">Digital Design Divide, following which educators should improve in creating technology-enabled learning experiences;</li><li id="">Digital Access Divide, addressing the need for equitable access to educational technology and resources.</li></ul><p id="">These points show the ongoing efforts to use technology to improve educational outcomes and access.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="14"></div></div><h3 id="">Equity and Inclusion</h3><p id="">Institutions devise strategies for making education increasingly accessible to underrepresented groups. These strategies may encompass various aspects, such as curricula designed with multiple perspectives and technologies. They ensure that every learner, whoever they are, has an opportunity to learn.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="15"></div></div><h3 id="">Expansion of Inequality</h3><p id="">UNESCO claims that <a href="https://www.unesco.org/gem-report/en/articles/244m-children-wont-start-new-school-year" id="">244M children</a> couldn\'t start the new school year in 2022. This means at least the same number of people won\'t apply to colleges and universities in a few years. Inequalities dilate through funding gaps and the impact the pandemic has had on low-income students. Most people still lack a stable Internet connection, which minimizes their ability to access educational resources online.</p><p id="">It means systemic changes must be implemented to ensure equal educational opportunities for all learners. Businesses focus on faster 5G roll-out to provide 100% quality connection worldwide. However, the tech progress isn\'t enough. Both public and private sectors should work jointly to provide relevant investment and increase awareness to get people back to educational institutions.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="16"></div></div><h2 id="">Summary</h2><p id="">Due to the tech revolution, studying feels like stepping right into a future we used to only dream about. VR, AR, and AI transform classrooms into dynamic, interactive worlds, and remote learning helps maintain a healthy study-life balance.&nbsp;</p><p id="">However, we should consider both current trends and issues in education to get the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Taking advantage of all the benefits technology education trends provide is crucial. But remember that innovations are implemented only to support us, not replace us. Use them thoughtfully, considering knowledge gaining as a core priority.</p>',

      '<p id="">Have you recently found yourself scrolling aimlessly through social media, wondering why you’re unable to focus on work, school, or hobbies? You’re not alone - over the past few decades, our collective ability to focus has slowly diminished.&nbsp;</p><p id="">The internet has made vast quantities of information available at our fingertips, but it’s also filled with the possibility of distraction. Social media platforms are designed to constantly feed us new content, with short, skimmable posts and videos that can be consumed in just a few seconds. This has created a culture of instant gratification where users expect all content and information to be made accessible at the push of a button.&nbsp;</p><p id="">When a lack of concentration affects your productivity and makes it difficult to achieve your goals, it can be very frustrating. Understanding what’s causing this inability to focus is the first step to fixing the problem. In this article, we’ll take a look at why it’s so hard to focus right now, as well as tips to focus and improve concentration in spite of all the distractions currently available to us.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="1"></div></div><h2 id="">Why can’t I focus?&nbsp;</h2><p id="">If you’ve been thinking “I can’t focus on anything” more often than normal recently, you’re not alone. There are a variety of societal factors that have come together in recent years to create the perfect storm of distraction. Here are some of the reasons why it feels harder to focus now than ever before.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="2"></div></div><h3 id="">Advancing technology</h3><p id="">As consumer technology has become more advanced, it means that entertainment is available at the click of a button. There are endless options to choose from, whether it’s TV shows, video games, social media content, or just aimless web browsing. When the entertainment you love is available right at your fingertips all the time, it can be difficult to stay focused on important work tasks.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Many people also have this entertainment available on the go thanks to smartphones, tablets, and laptops. These items are more accessible now than ever as budget options have entered the market and overall costs are going down. This makes it even harder to disconnect while out and about.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="3"></div></div><h3 id="">Remote work and school</h3><p id="">Remote work and education options were available prior to 2020, but they became widespread when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. The spread of COVID-19 has slowed down in many parts of the world, but remote work has continued.&nbsp;</p><p id="">While working remotely has many benefits, it also presents some unique challenges in terms of distraction. Without coworkers around, it’s easy to get sucked into all the temptations of the internet. Family members, roommates, and pets can make it even more difficult to stay focused. For students, Assignment24 can help minimize the stress of remote classes. Through this platform, students can get support on a variety of tasks with the help of academic freelancers. At Assignment24, we understand that university classes can be very stressful. We want you to have an enjoyable college experience, so don’t hesitate to contact us if you ever need help with an assignment. Click the button below and one of our experts will be happy to assist you!</p><p id="">‍</p><p id=""><a href="#" id=""><strong id=""><em id="">Get Help Now</em></strong></a></p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="4"></div></div><h3 id="">Social media and short dopamine cycles</h3><p id="">Social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok are more than just a major distraction - they’ve also rewired the way we think. These apps are designed to be addicting, as they constantly refresh and upload more data, allowing you to scroll endlessly. Because users are always posting new content, it can be tempting to check social media platforms constantly to make sure you don’t miss anything.&nbsp;</p><p id="">More specifically, social media has shortened the dopamine cycles in our brains. Our brains release dopamine when we engage in positive behaviors, whether that’s eating, exercising, or having positive social interactions. Dopamine makes us feel good, which motivates us to continue engaging in these behaviors. This means that every time we get a message or someone likes our post on social media, we get a dopamine hit, which motivates us to continue spending time on social media.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="5"></div></div><h3 id="">Lack of in-person connection</h3><p id="">With people spending more time than ever online, digital communication has replaced in-person interaction in many cases. This means that people are relying on the internet for everything from professional networking to friendship to romantic and sexual interactions, which can be very isolating.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Many people invest in parasocial relationships via social media, which are one-sided relationships with celebrities or social media influencers. These are particularly common on platforms like Twitch or OnlyFans, where viewers start to feel very connected to the content creators they follow. Widespread access to pornography online can also serve to further isolate people romantically and sexually, in addition to serving as a major distraction.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="6"></div></div><h3 id="">High stress levels</h3><p id="">When we feel stressed, it can make it even harder to focus on important tasks. Research indicates that we’re feeling more stressed than ever and mental health issues are at an all-time high. Economic, political, and climate concerns are ever-present, and isolation as a result of COVID-19 policies can also have a negative effect on mental health. Inflation is happening around the world and wages haven’t kept up, creating a huge amount of economic strain. Additionally, wars and other political conflicts have come to a head in many places. Combine that with the everyday challenges of work and school and it’s easy to see why such a large percentage of the population is dealing with anxiety.</p><p id="">When we feel stressed, it’s easy to use artificial digital rewards to make us feel better temporarily. However, this usually increases stress levels in the long run and can also lead to anxiety and depression. Things like video games, social media, and watching porn feel good in the interim, but are no substitute for fulfilling relationships and reaching your goals in real life. Ultimately, these digital rewards compound the cycle of stress you are in.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="7"></div></div><h2 id="">What happens when we are easily distracted?</h2><p id="">Having <strong id="">trouble focusing</strong> can negatively affect your life in many different ways. One of the most serious negative effects of this is poor performance at school or work. While many people struggle with a lack of focus, employers and academic institutions continue to have high expectations. Constant distraction can make it hard to keep up and achieve your goals.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Outside of work and school, these distractions can also affect our ability to engage in other healthy behaviors. When we’re sucked into online distractions, we may not want to participate in hobbies or make new friends. This can have a very negative effect on overall mental health. For those already struggling with mental health issues, online distractions can exacerbate the problem. For example, social media can cause us to constantly compare ourselves to others, which can lead to very negative self-esteem.&nbsp;</p><p id="">On top of this, digital distractions can also lead to poor sleep. Smartphones and computers emit large quantities of blue light, which negatively affect our sleep cycle. This creates a vicious cycle, as an inability to sleep can negatively affect your mood and make it even harder to focus the next day.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="8"></div></div><h2 id="">How can we improve our focus?&nbsp;</h2><p id="">While our collective loss of focus as a society is certainly concerning, it’s not inevitable. There are steps that anyone can take to improve their ability to concentrate. Many of these are simple changes that you can make throughout your day with a bit of attention. Over time, an increase in focus can help you be more productive during the day, and it can also improve your mental health. Here are some tips on how to improve focus and improve concentration.&nbsp;</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Use productivity timers while working. The Pomodoro method is a particularly effective focusing technique to increase your productivity. With this method, you’ll work in 25 minute increments, taking five minute breaks in the middle. Scheduling times for designated tasks as well as breaks can help you avoid distractions and stay motivated.&nbsp;</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Find an accountability partner. Many people benefit from external motivation when trying to reach a new goal. If you’re working on something personally or professionally, ask someone in your life to be your accountability partner and check in on your progress. Strengthening these personal relationships can help you push through distraction.&nbsp;</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Don’t be afraid to ask for help. If you feel like there’s too much on your plate, don’t try to force yourself to push through it. This will increase your stress levels, which can make it even harder to focus. When you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, don’t be afraid to look for extra support. This could be asking your friends and family for a favor or outsourcing some tasks at work. If you’re struggling with schoolwork, Assignment24 can take the most challenging tasks off your plate so you can recover.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p id="">‍</p><p id=""><a href="#" id=""><strong id=""><em id="">I Need Academic Help</em></strong></a></p><p id="">‍</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Track and limit your phone usage. Smartphones are a major source of distraction for many people. To combat this, start by tracking your smartphone usage. When do you spend the most time on your phone and what apps are the most distracting? Once you understand these distractions more thoroughly, you can set timers using digital wellbeing tools on your phone. This gives you a limited amount of time to enjoy your apps throughout the day before you lose access.&nbsp;</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Set boundaries with yourself and others. Setting boundaries and sticking to them are key to preventing distraction. Block off time on your calendar to tackle challenging work or school tasks. During this time, put your phone in another room and shut off messenger apps on your computer. It’s also important to set boundaries with coworkers regarding messages after work hours. If you can, consider taking time each day to enjoy an activity you love without your phone.&nbsp;</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Wind down without your devices. Getting good sleep each night is key to preventing distraction. Try to put your phone and computer away at least one hour before bed each night. If you’re still struggling to fall asleep, stretching, reading, meditation, or listening to soothing music can all be helpful. Additionally, consider using a traditional alarm clock rather than setting an alarm on your phone. This will allow you to wake up calmly in the morning without immediately opening your phone.&nbsp;</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Spend time outside. Being in nature can calm the mind and help improve focus. Take time when you can to go for walks or just relax in a nearby park, ideally without bringing any electronics. Really take the time to observe what’s around you - this can be a meditative process that helps improve your focus and mental health.&nbsp;</strong></li><li id=""><strong id="">Find mental health support when you need it. If you’re struggling with depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues, don’t feel like you have to face it alone.

Not really. The first year is about acclimatizing to a new environment and culture. Orientations and campus tours are indispensable in this process. They provide a comprehensive introduction to the campus layout, resources, and services available. They are an essential primer, helping students to get the physical and administrative peculiarities of their new academic setting. Want to make the first step in building a connection with the institution, its history, and its traditions? Then you should definitely join them.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="4"></div></div><h3 id="">“Remain at the epicenter” means “get involved”</h3><p id="">Is freshman year important? Yes, it helps you be involved. By participating in campus activities, you can connect with like-minded peers, pursue your interests, and contribute to the campus culture. This experience fuels your personal and social development. And last but not least – it enhances academic success. Involvement makes you a learner, leader, and a person capable of making a positive impact within the college community.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="5"></div></div><h3 id="">Fun or Study? Study!</h3><p id="">No worries; your college life is only gaining momentum. You still have much time to have fun, organize the best parties ever, and hang out with your friends. But remember you should do all these without sacrificing your studies. It doesn’t mean you should only work hard to find a good job in the future, not at all. The knowledge you gain helps you understand the world better and acquire skills that are crucial to succeeding. At least, it’s your core task in college - to learn more and explore what you’re capable of. Prove yourself you can do much more than you think. In a decade, you’ll understand how right these tips for incoming college freshmen are.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="6"></div></div><h2 id="">Freshman year of college: 3 Academic Strategies To Succeed&nbsp;</h2><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="7"></div></div><h3 id="">Stay organized&nbsp;</h3><p id="">Keep everything on the radar when you’re studying in college. Use planners, set up a study schedule, and identify effective study spaces. A planner can be a digital app or a traditional notebook, crucial for tracking assignments, deadlines, and exams. Effective study spaces, whether in the library, a quiet corner of a campus building, or a well-set-up desk at home, are key to avoiding distractions and enhancing productivity.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="8"></div></div><h3 id="">Engage with the academic environment</h3><p id="">Regular attendance in classes - here\'s what you should do during your first year in college. You\'ll still have time for fun, no worries. But remember that classes are your only way to engage in the learning process and get the most out of it. Interacting with professors during office hours is a strategic approach to deepening understanding, clarifying doubts, and establishing a rapport with the faculty.&nbsp;</p><p id="">As a freshman, you should use various academic resources such as tutoring centers, writing labs, and study groups to succeed. This way, you can get additional help, facilitate a deeper understanding of the material, and get strategies for efficient study practices.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="9"></div></div><h3 id="">Communicate with peers</h3><p id="">You’ll be surprised, but the lion’s share of success depends on how you communicate with people. Peers can share their experiences and thoughts on the processes and can advise you on how to approach different disciplines and where to get extra knowledge. If you have a friend who spent 2+ years in your college, you’re lucky since you have access to a treasury. Most likely, this person can share valuable insights on everything you need to know. You can consider the lessons learned and use them in your favor.&nbsp;</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/634e71ff52ffb6491eeec510/65f1c85f5355c9538350395e_FjHv97gHfa_87ebcoqXUXF8r1UKzuPFoFTS2nndZTQjdArfbIpoBuOmEtzrzW7fue1K0qSSGYGbtmxCNAm7srviMYqHaOWyFa5m4ARYcyJZbmala1sfCQD3ubcY0L5bORMhZzM1hCdE7lYyOBWlOkTU.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="" loading="auto" id=""></div></figure><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="10"></div></div><h2 id="">College advice for freshman: a comprehensive overview</h2><p id="">As you might get, freshman year is difficult because it’s time for you to grow up rapidly. Yesterday, you played video games at a high school; today, you must combine learning and a job, plan your resources, and take care of yourself as your parents did. Honestly, it’s a pretty tricky task since many adults still can’t follow the rules defined below. However, you should remain delighted with this period of your life.</p><h3>Personal Development and Wellness</h3><p id="">Freshman year is stressful, but you should do all your best to fix this. What do first year college students need? - Focus on your personal growth and wellness. Use strategies for personal development while prioritizing mental and physical health.&nbsp;</p><p id="">1) No comfort zone</p><p id="">One of the core freshman college tips is stepping out of your comfort zone. You might think you already did it, but the sky’s the limit. Seek opportunities that push the boundaries. College presents a unique landscape filled with diverse activities, clubs, and social events that offer avenues for personal growth and the discovery of new interests. Engaging in these experiences can be transformative, allowing students to explore unknown passions, develop new skills, and build confidence.&nbsp;</p><p id="">For a college freshman, taking the leap to join a club, volunteer, or participate in a campus event can catalyze a journey of self-discovery and personal fulfillment. It’s not always convenient, especially for introverts, but it helps you to grow and develop in a fraction of the time.&nbsp;</p><p id="">2) Mental &amp; physical health first</p><p id="">Catch tips for freshmen in college: get enough sleep, move your body regularly, and eat stuff that\'s actually good. It can really make a huge difference. Not just for acing your exams, but for feeling great, too.</p><p id="">So, as you\'re getting into the swing of college life, try to find a rhythm that lets you rest up, stay active, and eat well. It\'s like setting up a personal maintenance routine to keep you running smoothly.</p><p id="">But you also should have some time for yourself. Whether it\'s zoning out for a bit with some meditation, getting lost in your favorite hobby, or just taking a moment to breathe, it\'s all about keeping that stress at bay and avoiding burning out.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Also, a little piece of advice. Listen to your body. If you need a break, take it. And remember, there\'s a whole bunch of support services around campus just waiting to help if things get tough. So, don\'t be shy about reaching out.</p><h3>Financial and Practical Skills</h3><p id="">Budgeting sounds like a drag now, but getting a grip on this can seriously save you a ton of cash down the line.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Kicking things off with a budget is pretty much your first step to financial freedom. It\'s all about keeping an eye on what\'s coming in, and what\'s going out and making sure you\'re not left scratching your head at the end of the month. Getting savvy with your savings and spending can make a massive difference in how well you manage your college funds.</p><p id="">As a first-time college student, you should consider what you\'re splashing your cash on. Essentials first, always. But also, get creative in cutting down those extra costs, like snagging those sweet student deals, opting for pre-owned textbooks, or sharing expenses with your roomies. These moves can help make your money stretch way further than you\'d think.</p><p id="">This isn\'t just about making ends meet. It\'s about setting yourself up for a stress-free college life where you can focus on your studies and have fun without the money worries hanging over you.&nbsp;</p><h3>Transportation Arrangements</h3><p id="">Getting around town and campus doesn\'t have to be a headache. What college freshmen need to know is that it\'s super important to get the lowdown on your local public transport. Loads of colleges have got your back with free or cheap transit passes, so you can zip around without zapping your wallet. It’s pretty much the smart move for your budget.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Try mapping out your travel plans ahead of time. It’s a simple step that can save you from running late or getting caught in the dreaded rush. Plus, it\'s a stress-buster.</p><p id="">For those of you lucky enough to live on or near campus, why not give biking or walking a shot? It’s not just great for your health; it\'s your golden ticket to really getting to know your campus and the neighborhood. Plus, you can’t beat the fresh air and the chance to clear your head between study sessions.</p><h3>Academic and Professional Relationships</h3><p id="">Networking in college can seriously spice up your college life and beyond. First up, your classmates. They\'re not just fellow note-takers; they\'re potential study buddies, friends for life, and maybe even future business partners. Sharing what you know, forming study groups, or just hanging out can make your college journey way more fun and fruitful.</p><p id="">And don\'t forget about your professors. These folks are like gold mines of knowledge, college freshman advice, and yes, those precious letters of recommendation. So, don’t be shy – speak up in class and make those office hour visits count.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Alumni are your secret weapon for the “what comes next” part of college. They’ve been exactly where you are and made it to the other side. Reaching out can get you the inside scoop on navigating the leap from college to career, and who knows, maybe even lead to job opportunities. Lots of schools have alumni networks and mentorship programs just for this.</p><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/634e71ff52ffb6491eeec510/65f1c85e8c48e3830d44a4d3_xvCcUpBOXzSfqYbeVCCbQ6hHiXL6H8gmxYBSeGVwzi9LNIZ9YON85xdGZAr806qXe3mlqX5p5ChghRzORI7ojKAGc1qK24LNKs01wtAxO-ydOetkB0t7YHSOyHTdfVwpdZ7MeNT96yOk1N4HUziTLmM.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="" loading="auto" id=""></div></figure><h3>Exploring Beyond Campus</h3><p id="">Step off campus. There\'s a whole world out there just waiting to add some extra color to your college days. What do first year college students need? - Check out museums, chill in parks, soak in some history, or visit concerts and festivals. There\'s so much out there to make your student life even richer.&nbsp;</p><p id="">And it\'s not just about fun. Wandering around your local area can uncover some real gems like the perfect coffee shop to hunker down with your books, quirky places to grab a bite, or opportunities to lend a hand and make a difference.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Getting to know the community outside your college bubble is super rewarding. It\'s a chance to connect with different folks and cultures and really feel like you\'re part of something bigger. You can take what you\'re learning in class and see how it applies in the real world, making your studies more interesting and inspiring.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="11"></div></div><h2 id="">Conclusion</h2><p id="">Take a moment to feel what is a freshman in college and really appreciate what this year means. It\'s not just the kickoff of your college journey; it\'s an opportunity for growth and exploration that defines what comes after freshman year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id="">Think of this time as your personal playground for discovering what you love, pushing your limits, and stepping out into the unknown. Your first year is also prime time for getting those study habits in top shape, making meaningful connections with the folks around you, and keeping your health and happiness on the front burner.&nbsp;</p><p id="">By using these tips to surviving college, every chance to grow, reaching out for <a href="https://paper24.com" id="">academic help</a> when you need it, you\'re paving the way for a truly awesome college career.</p>',

In this case, they may ask the student to orally defend their work and answer questions directly from the professor on a face-to-face level.&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">Plagiarism Detectors - </strong>All academic work is submitted through Plagiarism detection software such as TurnItIn to ensure the originality of the writing. Such detectors scan a large database of sources, making it very difficult for a student to plagiarize.&nbsp;</p><p id="">According to Plagiarism.com, here are three common methods used by teachers when they encounter suspicious work:</p><ol id=""><li id=""><em id="">Reading an essay aloud in front of a student to see whether he is not worried too much to disclose that something is wrong.&nbsp;</em></li><li id=""><em id="">Asking a student to retell a random paragraph from his/her paper.

This is usually only applicable for smaller classroom sizes as a professor with a classroom size of 100 will no way be able to hold 100 different writing styles in their head.&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">Verbal Assessment - </strong>The teacher may ask the student to retell parts of their essay out loud and ask questions which are answered in the writing. If the student stalls or starts to get nervous, it is a pretty good sign that they have plagiarized.&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">Google Phrase Search - </strong>If the professor notices a specific comment or phrase that makes them suspicious of originality, they will normally do a quick google search of that phrase and see if they can find content that is very similar to what is written by the student. They would take the article from which the phrase has been used and read the content, then compare the content to the original content to see if the main idea was simply rephrased or the ideas are actually original.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="3"></div></div><h2 id="">What tools do they use to help them find plagiarism?</h2><ul id=""><li id="">Plagiarism detection tools (TurnItIn, Grammarly, Scribbr)</li><li id="">Google Phrase Search</li><li id="">Lie detectors (in severe cases)&nbsp;</li><li id="">Professor’s Instinct and Experience&nbsp;</li></ul>',

In this article, we’ll discuss 10 reasons the U.S. education system is failing, and how you can rise above a broken system to create a fulfilling, purposeful life.</p><p id="">Stephen P. Heyneman of Vanderbilt University wrote in his paper <em id="">The International Efficiency of American Education: The Bad and the Not-So-Bad News,"</em>...American schools perform worse than schools in many other countries [...] in science and mathematics. Not only may American schools perform worse, but they [...] use more resources than other school systems.

It originated during the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s and early 1900s as a way to train a workforce on a massive scale. The original arguments for public education were admirable:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Civic virtue: becoming a good citizen</li><li id="">Meritocracy: allowing the most gifted to rise to the top&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li id="">Social mobility: education can change one’s position in life&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li id="">Social stability: education can teach valuable skills&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li id="">Economic efficiency: allocating the right people to the right jobs</li></ul><p id=""><strong id="">The main premise for the establishment of public education is that students would return far more to the community than the community invests in them.</strong></p><p id="">The theory behind public schools is great. Except today, the system hasn’t kept up with changing times.</p><h3 id="">Poor training for life</h3><p id="">When you look at how passionately people go into the weekend and how Mondays are almost universally dreaded, schools have clearly failed in preparing us for careers that inspire us and make us want to give our best and continually improve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id="">AsapSCIENCE believes that school was designed to be boring and repetitive to prepare students for a routine life of assembly line work, not critical thinking, which is necessary for innovation.</p><p id="">School should be a launchpad for success in a way the individual defines success. However, it breeds conformism. Many wonderful minds are forcefully redirected toward more “reasonable” pursuits.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="">Learning as punishment</h3><p id="">The education system is designed to be strictly authoritarian, which makes it feel like punishment:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Sit down (and shut up)</li><li id="">Pledge allegiance to the flag</li><li id="">No talking or gum chewing</li><li id="">Ask permission to use the bathroom</li><li id="">Regurgitate information whether you understand it or not</li><li id="">No leaving the premises without permission</li></ul><p id="">This is how prisoners are treated! The system does not foster a lifelong love of learning.&nbsp;</p><h3 id="">It doesn’t serve every student</h3><p id="">Many bright minds are held back by a system burdened with a lack of funding, access to technology, as well as gender and socioeconomic inequality. The system also doesn’t adequately meet the needs of struggling or underprivileged students.</p><h3 id="">Graduates are often unprepared</h3><p id="">Many high school graduates are not proficient in the basics, including writing.

We’re all familiar with cringe-worthy participation trophies that do not prepare students for real life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">The American education system does not address the needs of individual students from incredibly diverse backgrounds.</strong></p><p id="">Two forces accelerated the irrelevance of the current education model:</p><ul id=""><li id="">The Information Age came quickly. Today, students have an incredible amount of information at their fingertips. Instead of slogging through 1,000-page textbooks (many of which still whitewash history), information is now instantly accessible on any device. However, not all have access to technology.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id="">The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically ushered-in remote learning as an unexpected evolution of education. Remote learning was great for high-achieving introverted students who were bored at school but proved detrimental to:</li></ul><ul id=""><li id="">Students without access to the internet or computers</li><li id="">Students with poor social skills (because they didn’t have in-person interactions with peers)</li><li id="">Students whose home environment was not conducive to learning</li></ul><h3 id=""><strong id="">7 Reasons the U.S. education system is failing its students&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id="">Here are seven reasons the U.S. education system is failing its students and why many graduate but few are proficient.</p><h4 id="">1. Overcrowded classroom/school closures</h4><p id="">Overcrowding is a direct consequence of school closures. It reduces students’ ability to pay attention because of classmates\' distractions and noise. It also reduces the teachers’ abilities to address the unique needs of each student, monitor classroom activity, and effectively teach the entire class. Nationwide, students in uncrowded classrooms significantly outperform their peers in crowded classrooms.&nbsp;</p><h4 id="">2. Poor school funding&nbsp;</h4><p id="">Funding for most K-12 schools comes from state and local funds generated by property, sales, and income taxes. However, funding doesn’t keep up. Budget deficits mean fewer teachers or lower teacher salaries; fewer enrichment programs (art and music are usually the first to be axed); and dwindling resources.</p><p id="">School is a hub of social life and a place to participate in sports or pursue varied interests. If activities are eliminated due to budget cuts, other personal enrichment opportunities may not be available for all students.</p><h4 id="">3. Lack of innovation in teacher education (outdated teaching methods)</h4><p id="">100-year-old teaching methods don’t work for the modern student. Traditional learning involves memorizing information without necessarily understanding its value or application. Teaching by rote memorization does not lead to understanding; but it’s great for testing.</p><h4 id="">4. Outdated student assessment and standardized testing&nbsp;</h4><p id="">While students need regular assessments, standardized testing comes with challenges:</p><p id="">It Doesn’t Work</p><p id="">Graduation rates are rising, but graduates are not proficient in the basics. In 2019, 15.1 million U.S. students attended high school, a record 85.3% graduated, and only 6% dropped out.</p><p id="">However, the reality of 2019 pre-pandemic proficiency at graduation tells a different story:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Reading: Only 37% of seniors scored at or above “proficient”&nbsp;</li><li id="">Math: 24% of seniors scored at or above “proficient” with 40% “below basic.”</li><li id="">The gap between “proficient” and “below basic” students grew, putting the least-proficient seniors even further behind their peers</li></ul><h5 id="">Income gap = score gap</h5><p id="">Studies show that low-income students perform lower than affluent students on standardized testing, partly because low-income students can’t afford private tutors.</p><h5 id="">Student stress</h5><p id="">Students are under immense pressure to test well.</p><ul id=""><li id="">Standardized testing is tied to important outcomes, including graduating and college acceptance.</li><li id="">It heavily emphasizes reading, writing, science, and math and devalues history, the humanities, and the arts.&nbsp;</li><li id="">There is no assessment of emotional intelligence (compassion and empathy)&nbsp;</li><li id="">It fails to accurately assess students who don’t test well but demonstrate proficiency in other ways (someone can be a great writer, but not know how to name sentence structure).</li><li id="">It does not account for learning disabilities, challenging home situations, lack of internet/computer access, or language deficiencies.</li><li id="">Instead of nurturing a child’s innate love of learning, standardized testing teaches them to be test-takers and in the process, it arguably kills the joy of learning by forcing fact retention.</li></ul><h5 id="">Teacher stress</h5><p id="">Teachers are likewise under immense pressure to ensure their students test well.</p><ul id=""><li id="">Standardized tests are tied to school funding; teachers are pressured to demonstrate performance and improvement</li><li id="">Teachers must “teach to the test” rather than the curriculum&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li id="">Preparation and administration of tests require significant teaching time</li><li id="">Tests measure achievement without measuring progress</li><li id="">Heavy blame on teachers if classroom scores are low, and heavy blame if scores are high because of the time taken away from learning&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p id="">‍</p><p id=""><strong id="">Standardized testing fails students because life is not a series of standardized tests.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id="">Life throws opportunities and monkey wrenches into everyone’s lives. Learning test-taking does not promote innovation, fast action when an opportunity arises, or confidence that a skill can be learned in the field. It does not measure progress, which is intrinsically more motivating than actually achieving a goal.</p><h4 id="">5. Lack of parental involvement</h4><p id="">Modern parents are in a pickle. The old single-income household model is no longer an economic possibility for most families. While the lowest parental participation comes from socio-economically disadvantaged or single-parent families, middle to upper-class parents aren’t as involved today because both parents are career-focused.</p><p id="">Teachers can’t parent kids, though they are often expected to. A student’s home environment directly affects their academic and personal development. Parents may be at work, leaving kids unsupervised. Single parents find it even harder to be involved in school. Career-focused parents may not be able to unplug from their responsibilities, come down to the child’s level, and engage in play-learning.</p><h4 id="">6. Rising poverty and technological inequality</h4><p id="">Low-income/minority school districts are rarely set up to use technology as a learning tool. This was brought to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic when millions of students were forced to learn remotely.</p><p id="">While technology creates the potential for remote learning, more active student engagement outside of the classroom, and instant access to up-to-date resources, it’s not accessible to all. It also comes with its own challenges, including distraction and easy cheating.</p><h4 id="">7. Poor student mental health&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4><p id="">Mass shootings have most parents, teachers, and students anxious about school safety. Teachers are expected to spot troubled kids and protect the lives of every student. More guns? Fewer guns? Either way, the problem is poor mental health.</p><p id="">Part of the student mental health crisis is anti-intellectualism (making fun of bright kids) and bullying.</p><ul id=""><li id="">Bright kids are bored and socially ostracized</li><li id="">Struggling kids aren’t getting help</li><li id="">Bullying is widespread</li><li id="">There aren’t enough mental health counselors available</li><li id="">Mental health carries a stigma that prevents students from seeking help</li><li id="">Social media is a powerful driver of student desires and aspirations but at the same time, it fosters low self-esteem</li></ul><p id="">The National Center for Education Statistics states that over 20% of students in grades 6-12 have been bullied. Bullied students exhibit physical, emotional, and behavioral problems that can lead to poor academic performance, poor social experiences, and violence.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="3" class="blog-anchor"></div></div><h2 id=""><strong id="">How to fix the education system</strong></h2><p id="">Improving the education system in America isn’t easy. Some school districts are taking steps in the right direction, but it will take years before most school districts can shift toward a better system, partly because enrollment in public schools is down and alternatives are becoming more popular. Solutions include:</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">1. Reducing classroom size/increasing school funding</strong></h3><p id="">Cash-strapped states aren’t the reason schools are underfunded. It’s priorities. The annual cost of incarcerating a prisoner in New York State was $39,158 in 2020. The annual per pupil spending in New York State (which has the highest per-student spending in the country) was just $25,520.</p><p id="">What would our education system look like if we spent as much on education as we do on incarceration?&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">Boosting school funding will happen only when the <em id="">value </em>of education is seen as a driver of the country’s economic health.</strong>&nbsp;</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">2. Increase access to technology</strong></h3><p id="">Technology is shaping the future of American schools. Bringing schools into the digital age is largely funding-dependent.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Remote learning has brought to light the challenges kids face when they don’t have access to computers and the internet. Technology for all kids needs to be prioritized during the allocation of school funds.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">3. Eliminate standardized testing</strong></h3><p id="">More K-12 school districts are finding innovative ways to measure students\' proficiency levels by limiting standardized testing.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Portfolio-based assessments can demonstrate progress, achievement, and real-life application of information. Portfolios can include written assignments, art or graphic work, completed tests, lab reports, honors, awards, or other documents.</p><p id="">A combination of standardized testing and portfolio-based assessments could achieve funding objectives and deliver more accurate student assessments.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">4. Encourage more parent involvement</strong></h3><p id="">When parents are involved, kids perform better.</p><p id="">In two-income or single-parent families, increasing parent involvement is not easy. Technology can facilitate frequent parent-teacher communication without formal meetings. Parents can also become more involved by setting clear academic expectations and holding their children to those standards by getting kids whelp when they’re struggling (such as tutoring, writing services, and mentoring).</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">5. Update teaching methods&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id="">Teaching methods that keep up with the digital age can include continuing education for teachers (and certification renewals), and in-classroom technology that personalizes lessons or gives more in-depth teaching on difficult subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">6. Boost community involvement&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id="">A shift in public perception from apathy to an emphasis on education is needed, especially in communities not heavily invested in education.&nbsp;</p><p id="">One forward-thinking idea is to repurpose closed schools into centers for adult education to enrich adults that may not have previously seen the value of education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=""><strong id="">A combination of parent and community involvement, increased funding, and upgraded teaching methods can help manage the student mental health crisis.</strong></p><h3 id=""><strong id="">7. Start school later</strong></h3><p id="">One approach that will help students is later starting times. Schools need to push back start times to boost learning, attention, and engagement and prevent mental health problems. Sleep deprivation is directly linked to poor mental health, yet kids are expected to be in school as early as 7:25. Chronic sleep deprivation can lead to psychological disorders.&nbsp;</p><p id="">According to AsapSCIENCE, schools that have implemented later start times have seen huge increases in verbal SAT scores (+150 points) and math SAT scores (+90 points).&nbsp;</p><p id="">“When sleep is abundant, minds flourish,” says Matthew Walker, PhD, <em id="">Why We Sleep</em></p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="4" class="blog-anchor"></div></div><h2 id=""><strong id="">How to rise above the limitations of the U.S. education system</strong></h2><p id="">Knowing the limitations of the U.S. education system can help you fill in the gaps:</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">1. Up-level your communication skills</strong></h3><p id="">Even the most brilliant idea has to be communicated; only then will it be worth anything.&nbsp;</p><p id="">You don’t need to become a speaker or an author; just learn to communicate clearly and persuasively in speech and writing. Communication skills enhance your personal value, and therefore, your opportunities.</p><p id="">Assignment24 can help. You will leverage the expertise of qualified individuals to ensure correct and well-researched work. These assignments will give you in-depth knowledge of the subject matter as well as examples of clear communication: a win-win for the student.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id="">‍</p><p id=""><a href="#" id=""><strong id=""><em id="">Get Help Now</em></strong></a></p><p id="">‍</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">2. Use the internet</strong></h3><p id="">Self-educate yourself on your smartphone. Resist the temptation of distractions and follow interesting and successful people, organizations, businesses, and schools whose content enriches you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">3. Know your passions and find a way to make them pay</strong></h3><p id="">If you were told that “you can’t make a living doing that,” then prove them wrong. Don’t be a victim of student assessments or career counselors that didn’t show you what you’re <em id="">brilliant </em>at and love to do. If there’s a passion, there’s someone making a comfortable living doing it.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Career counselors may encourage you to seek highly competitive occupations. However, a more low-profile career might better serve your needs, personality, and ambitions.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">4. Find a mentor&nbsp;</strong></h3><p id="">Finding even one supportive adult can offer both immediate and long-term benefits. Look to local business owners, a favorite teacher, an athlete, or any achiever you admire. Mentoring:</p><ul id=""><li id="">Increases high school graduation and college enrollment rates and decreases high school dropout rates</li><li id="">Encourages better attitudes and behaviors in school</li><li id="">Enhances self-esteem and confidence</li><li id="">Encourages healthier relationships and lifestyle choices</li><li id="">Improves interpersonal skills and learning</li><li id="">Decreases the likelihood of alcohol and drug abuse</li></ul><h3 id=""><strong id="">5. Play more</strong></h3><p id="">Sir Ken Robinson suggests play (specifically outdoor play) can boost learning. There’s no reason why kids should sit to learn, or why education has to take place indoors on a beautiful day and keep kids incarcerated like high-security prisoners. Kids naturally learn by mimicking, doing, competing, and failing until they figure it out.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Movement encourages learning. Listen to an audiobook or recorded classroom notes while walking. Physical movement stimulates long-term memory and recall. Engaging in physical activity immediately before learning helps boost alertness and information processing.</p><h3 id=""><strong id="">6. Follow your path</strong></h3><p id="">Academic competition is fierce right from the get-go. Students compete for scholarships, spots on a team, and college acceptance. While there’s nothing wrong with healthy competition, it shouldn’t be a focus, especially if you seek a non-traditional path and competition is zapping your motivation.</p><p id="">While college is a great goal for some, not everyone should go to college, and certainly not just because that’s what society expects.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Plenty of vocations don’t require a university degree, including the trades. And yet there’s a stigma attached to being “just” a blue-collar auto mechanic as opposed to a college-educated white-collar management consultant. A trade or alternative school could be the better choice depending on your personal interests and ambitions.</p><p id="">College students are immediately saddled with enormous debt. There’s no way around paying college loans, not even bankruptcy. The solution? Work, of course. People who are in debt right out of school are more likely to conform.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Or, follow a non-traditional path and avoid the debt altogether.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="5" class="blog-anchor"></div></div><h2 id=""><strong id="">Can we fix the education problems in America?</strong></h2><p id="">Sir Robinson continues his Reimagine Education talk by saying,"... we\'re trying to make the old system work by putting more resources into it to make it more efficient but if the system is designed to do the wrong thing it doesn\'t matter how efficient it gets, it\'ll still do the wrong thing. Life thrives on diversity and our big mistake is to try and impose conformity.”</p><p id="">Children are born to learn. We are the most curious species on this planet, and yet we hate school. The shift to making schools serve their students has to happen from the ground up. Not by "them,” but by us: the students, the teachers, the parents, and the community.</p>',

      '<p id="">Every other hustle and bustle needs a breather. You know the mantra: work hard, play hard. College students especially need downtime to recharge to be able to absorb knowledge like sponges again. That\'s why college break schedules are dished out yearly: to help college students map their downtime effectively.</p><p id="">But here\'s the question: how can you return to college after a break without pain and suffering? Switching back to study mode is complex, and getting a little bit lax could mean a dip in your grades.</p><p id="">Want to avoid all the pitfalls and enjoy your breaks and your studies? Read on for best practices and tips on how to get back into college after taking a break smoothly.</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="1"></div></div><h2 id="">Can I take a break from college? - Yes, please!</h2><p id="">The college break is more or less a timeout for students to kick back from the relentless cycle of classes, homework, and tests. It’s a specific time during the semester when classes are interrupted, thus allowing students to relax, recharge, or go on trips and have some downtime. Do you have a summer break in college? If so, you know what it is: a vacation that never allows you to get tired but still keeps your morale a little higher, making the ride of education a little fun and something that you can handle.</p><p id="">So here’s a brief schedule to help you navigate:</p><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Fall Break:</strong> A small vacation of two to four days that colleges give in October. It follows the first challenging weeks of the semester.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Thanksgiving Break: </strong>Second-most-valued break during the year, usually from the Wednesday before Thanksgiving to the weekend.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Winter Vacation: </strong>This is the big one, starting in mid-December and running until the first week of January. About three to four weeks long, it\'s a time for Christmas celebrations and New Year\'s partying.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Spring Break: </strong>A week-long vacation in March or April, known chiefly for its travel and party culture. It usually gives students a time window for service trips or internships but also presents a chance to rest or finish up personal projects.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Summer Break: </strong>In college, it’s the most extended holiday from May to August, during which students have the opportunity to do internships, get jobs, and even travel.</li></ul><ul id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Reading Days:</strong> Placed throughout the semester, these usually fall before final exams. Though officially meant for days of study without classes, they provide a much-needed break for students to prepare for forthcoming examinations.</li></ul><h3 id="">Breaks on request: good or bad?</h3><p id="">How often should you take study breaks? Anytime when you need it. Did you know you can count on other breaks in your study? Yes, it’s not a mistake. Here you go, at least four options to make your life easier.</p><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Mental Health Days: </strong>Some colleges and universities respect mental health and permit students to take days off for their mental well-being. This option allows students to stop in case they are overwhelmed or just want to take a break for whatever reason brought on by stress or other mental health-related issues.</li></ol><ol start="2" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Study Abroad Breaks:</strong> Some may have special breaks matching the host country\'s academic calendar. It\'s a great time to take a trip and immerse yourself in a culture different from the one you studied in the classroom.</li></ol><ol start="3" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Leave of Absence: </strong>The student should submit an application for leave of absence in case of personal, health, or professional (internship) reasons that require them to stand back from the program of study for a longer period. This enables students to take a break of either a semester, one full year, or more and return to their studies without paying a penalty.</li></ol><ol start="4" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Gap Year: </strong>Sometimes, before or between college studies, some students take a year off and go on a so-called gap year, during which an individual timeout is taken for personal growth, traveling, volunteer work, or other experiences. Planning and college approval are needed, but for those who take it, it offers invaluable life experiences and a chance to rethink the goals lying ahead.</li></ol><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:697px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="697px"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/634e71ff52ffb6491eeec510/65f1ccfacbf3c39a6693b9ee_Infographic-TypesOfGapYearStudents-1.png" loading="lazy" alt="__wf_reserved_inherit" width="auto" height="auto" id=""></div></figure><p id="">College breaks requested for personal or health reasons often arouse mixed feelings in students, tutors, and the general public. Still, many understand and support such personal choice, considering it rather crucial for mental health and development.&nbsp;</p><p id="">Nevertheless, in society, an undercurrent insists on judging it. Taking a break might mean someone is not resilient or committed. Both you and your parents might worry about how to go back to college after this vacation. However, the tutors mostly appreciate that such breaks are needed since a student who has taken adequate rest becomes more involved and yields higher productivity.&nbsp;</p><p id="">The moral dilemma sets in when people equate taking a break to the easy way out, not giving appropriate credit to the value of taking some time off. This cultural shift has to happen so that mental health and personal well-being are seen as part of academic and professional success, not a luxury.&nbsp;</p><div data-rt-embed-type=\'true\'><div id="3"></div></div><h2 id="">How to take a break from college: top 7 steps to follow</h2><ol id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Reflect on why you need it</strong></li></ol><p id="">Spend some time thinking about why you need a break. Whether for issues with mental health, personal reasons, or exploring other opportunities, you should analyze the reasons. It will help guide your actions and easily voice your needs.</p><ol start="2" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Learn your college\'s policies</strong></li></ol><p id="">Policies on time off are likely different in each college. Know more about formal leave of absence, informal gap year, or a "mental health break," along with deadlines or necessary documents.</p><ol start="3" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Consult the academic advisor</strong></li></ol><p id="">They\'re in a better position to advise you on how the break may impact your academic progress and, if possible, assist in planning a return. Equally, academic advisors will provide a way to stay in touch with the college during your break.</p><ol start="4" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Prepare your documentation</strong></li></ol><p id="">Remember to prepare, if needed, any form or letter explaining the reason for needing the break. Be honest about the reasons; if there is any evidence to be attached, then do that.</p><ol start="5" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Work on your time off plan</strong></li></ol><p id="">Think of what you want to do with your time off. The plan is the thing that makes any activity during your break, be it working, traveling, doing your stuff, or just resting, more effective and purposeful.</p><ol start="6" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Stay in touch</strong></li></ol><p id="">If possible, always stay in touch with your classmates and friends. The most surprising fact is that being aware of events can make it easier to return to college and stay updated with all important changes.</p><ol start="7" id=""><li id=""><strong id="">Plan your return</strong></li></ol><p id="">Decide when and how you want to return to your studies before your break.
